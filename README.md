ORBIT solves the problem of finding relevant hobbies or roles that match a user's true preferences and constraints. Traditional questionnaires are static, long, and often biased. ORBIT uses adaptive questioning powered by Bayesian inference to efficiently converge on accurate matches while maintaining a neutral, conversational user experience.
